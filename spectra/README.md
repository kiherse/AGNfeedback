Optical nuclear spectra for a sample of 19-type II quasars with z = [0.3,0.41], from (Bessiere et al. 2017).

The original optical spectroscopic data used in this work, described in Bessiere et al. (2017), were mainly obtained using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS-S) mounted on the Gemini South telescope (Cerro PachÂ´on, Chile).
There are three exceptions: 
- J0217-00, whose spectrum was obtained from OSIRIS mounted in the GTC (Roque de los Muchachos, Islas Canarias).
- J0114+00 and J0142+14, downloaded from SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey).
- 
For extracting the nuclear 1-dimensional spectra we used the task APALL from the package twodspec, from IRAF.
